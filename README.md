## Using Python I built a 2048 game, very straight forward.

### PR needed:
> The game remembers all keys pressed and the animation is trying to keep up.
  I want the pressing of one key to neutralize further pressing until the animation ctaches up, then the keys should be enabled again,
  so that the only way the player can make a move is when the screen is still.
> Some sound effects and some background music while you're at it.
